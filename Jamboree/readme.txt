Problem statement:Perform analysis to help Jamboree in understanding what factors are important ingraduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves.Also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.
Dataset: We are provided with data of the students and their chance of admit.The target variable is 'Chance of admit'. We will be using this dataset to draw meaningful insights and build a model to predict the chance of admission. 
The features present in the dataset are:GRE Score,TOEFL score,University rating,SPO,GPA,Research experience,Chance of admit
Steps: The steps involved in this project are data loading,non graphical analysis , graphical analysis(univariate and bivariate),missing values and outlier detection,splitting the dataset into train and test.
building linear regression model to predict the chance of admission,checking for multicollinearity,evaluating the metrics and testing the assumptions of the linear regression.
Pyhton libraries used: Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib,sklearn,statsmodel.api

Important Note: The insights and comments are mentioned under each visualization in the ipynb file. Recommendations are mentioned at the end of the code.
